## 2026-01-29: Position-Based Heading Estimation

### Problem

GPS course-over-ground (COG) is unreliable at low walking speeds. During field testing on the tennis court, the robot exhibited erratic heading behavior because:

1. **COG requires significant velocity** - GPS COG is only accurate when moving >0.5 m/s, but the robot walks at ~0.3 m/s
2. **COG updates lag** - Even when valid, COG reflects past motion, not current orientation
3. **Stationary COG is meaningless** - When stopped or turning in place, COG provides no useful heading information

### Root Cause Analysis

From the 2026-01-29 test logs:
- Robot would frequently oscillate or spin because GPS COG was either `None` or stale
- After GPS fix recovery, robot would resume with old heading values, causing incorrect corrections
- Heading error calculations were based on unreliable COG data

### Solution: Position-Based Heading

Instead of relying on GPS COG, heading is now computed from actual position changes:

1. **Track previous position** - Store the last RTK position when heading was updated
2. **Compute displacement** - Calculate distance traveled using haversine formula
3. **Update heading on sufficient movement** - Only update heading after moving >0.1m forward
4. **Forward motion only** - Only update heading when `vx > 0` (walking forward), not during rotation

### Algorithm

```
if moving_forward AND displacement > 1.5m:
    heading = bearing(prev_pos, current_pos)
    prev_pos = current_pos
```

The 1.5m threshold ensures the displacement is well above GPS noise (RTK Float can have 10-50cm accuracy).

### Other Changes

- **Reset heading on fix restore** - After GPS outage, heading and prev_pos are reset to `None`, forcing the robot to walk forward briefly to re-establish heading
- **Enhanced logging** - Navigation loop now logs fix type and horizontal accuracy every iteration for easier debugging
- **Moved logs directory** - Logs now stored in `autonomous_nav/mission/logs/` (previously `autonomous_nav/mission_logs/`)

### Verification

1. Robot should walk forward initially when heading is unknown
2. After ~1.5m of forward movement (~5 seconds), heading stabilizes
3. Robot turns toward waypoint and navigates
4. Logs show consistent heading values during forward motion
